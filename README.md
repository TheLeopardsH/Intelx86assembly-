There are two notations used in intel Assembly AT&T and Intel Syntax,I would use intel Syntax

Major difference is the source destination location  and $ sign.For example

In AT&T : 
* *mov $4, %eax // GP register assignment*
* *mov $4, %(eax) // Memory assignment*

But in Intel : 
* *mov eax, 4 // GP register assignment*
* *mov [eax],4 // Memory assignment*




### Regiters in x86
```
General purpose registers:EAX,ABX,ACX,ABX,ESI,EDI,EIP
Special purpose registers:ESP,EBP
```

|ECX   |         CX         |    CH      |    CL         |ECX is known as the counter since it is used to hold a loop index

AX = accumulator
DX = double word accumulator
CX = counter
BX = base register
SI = Source Index
DI = Destination Index
<!-- 
    calling convention
    call 0xAE436784(i.e push eip+5(address after the function in i think ; jmp 0xAE436784)
     ret (pop eip)
     f(a,b) (push b;push a,call f)  arguments in reverse order   
     hardware stack is based on push, pop, call, and ret instructions-->
